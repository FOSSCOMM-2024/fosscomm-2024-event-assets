  EVENT ASSETS REPOSITORY
</h1>

## 🚀 Overview
Welcome to the **FOSSCOMM 2024 Brand Assets Repository**! 🎉  
This repository contains all the official branding materials for FOSSCOMM 2024. It is designed to make it easy for contributors, organizers, and participants to access and utilize event assets.  

The application consists of two main components:
- The backend: A FastAPI-based REST API that handles the analysis and provides the necessary endpoints.
- The frontend: A React-based user interface that allows users to interact with the analysis results.
